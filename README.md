A Simple Simon inspired entry for the JS13K 2012 Competition http://js13kgames.com/

Instructions
---------------
*At each level of the game you will be presented with 4 coloured code discs
*Each disc will pulse and glow in a coded sequence
*When the 'ENTER CODE SEQUENCE' message displays, click on the coloured discs in the same order as the coded sequence
*If your entry matches the coded sequence, the sequence will display again with an additional sequence step
*Continue entering the code sequence until the full sequence is entered and you level up
*If you enter the sequence incorrectly at any time you will be locked out and have to start the level again

Good Luck!
